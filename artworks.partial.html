      There are many reasons why the Renaissance is considered to be such an
      important cultural period. It was a time of renewed interest in classical
      learning and culture. This led to a flowering of art, literature, and
      philosophy that was unprecedented in Western history.
    </p>
    <p class="learningtext__paragraph-additional">
      The Renaissance saw the rise of humanism, a new way of thinking about the
      individual and their place in the world. This new way of thinking had a
      profound impact on society, and it continues to influence our thinking
      today. The Renaissance also had a significant impact on the arts. Artists
      began to focus on depicting the world around them in a more realistic way,
      and they also began to explore new subjects and techniques.
