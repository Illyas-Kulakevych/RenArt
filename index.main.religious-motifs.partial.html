   <h3 class="religious__artist-title">Bartolomé Esteban Murillo 
    <span class="religious__painting-title"><em>"Virgin and Child"</em></span></h3>
   <p class="religious__description">This painting is full of symbolism. Some people believe that the painting represents the different 
        aspects of Jesus's nature, both human and divine. Others believe that the painting is an allegory 
        of the soul's journey to enlightenment.</p>

   <h3 class="religious__artist-title">Raphael
    <span class="religious__painting-title"><em>"The Transfiguration"<em></span></h3>
   <p class="religious__description">Murillo's paintings of the Virgin and Child are popular because he imbues the traditional theme with
        a sense of intimacy and sweetness. This is evident in the soft modelling of the figures, as well 
        as in the infant's momentary glance away from the Virgin.</p>

   <p class="religious__subtitle">FOLLOWING THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE PAINTER'S ANCESTORS</p>
   <p class="religious__description">This painting, The Grocer's Shop, can serve as a pendant to The Poultry Seller, which was painted by
     the father of Frans van Mieris the Younger and is also on display. The egg basket at the upper right 
     appears to have been passed down through the generations.</p>
