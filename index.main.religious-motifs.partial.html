        <span class="religious__painting-title"><em>"Virgin and Child"</em></span>
        <p class="religious__description">
          This painting is full of symbolism. Some people believe that the painting represents the different 
          aspects of Jesus's nature, both human and divine. Others believe that the painting is an allegory 
          of the soul's journey to enlightenment.

        <span class="religious__painting-title"><em>"The Transfiguration"<em></span>
        <p class="religious__description">
          Murillo's paintings of the Virgin and Child are popular because he imbues the traditional theme with
          a sense of intimacy and sweetness. This is evident in the soft modelling of the figures, as well 
          as in the infant's momentary glance away from the Virgin.

      <p class="religious__description">This painting, The Grocer's Shop, can serve as a pendant to The 
        Poultry Seller, which was painted by the father of Frans van Mieris the Younger and is also on 
        display. The egg basket at the upper right appears to have been passed down through the generations.
